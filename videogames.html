              Video games have been a part of my life ever since I was a
              child. Although there are many other games that <br>I like
              to play on different consoles, here are my 4 favorites.

            With 4 extensive stories, lots of action, and a knack <br>for
            heroism, "Halo: The Master Chief Collection" is my favorite <br>video
            game because it shows the story of Spartan John 117 in the <br>distant
            future as he fights to save humanity and discover who he is.

            A struggle between 2 groups of Spartans in the distant <br>future
            proves to lead to their own destruction. "Halo 5: Guardians" <br>lands
            at #2 because of the interesting story and the introduction <br>of
            new multiplayer modes that bring more action and more fun.

            Ever since I was a child, I was always <br>fascinated by
            "Lego" video games because they always had many <br>different
            different puzzles to solve. They also made me think of <br>creative
            ways to get out of a situation and finish the level. <br>"Lego:
            The Hobbit" is no exception to this.

            The thrill of racing can never get old in <br>"Forza Horizon
            2". While racing through mountains, highways, and <br>small
            towns as my circuits, it was easy to forget that it was <br>just
            a video game.
