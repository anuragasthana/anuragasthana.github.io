		<p> Travelling is one of my favorite pasttimes. For the past few years my family and I
      have traveled to many different places together. I have enjoyed each and
      every one of our trips. Below are some of my most memorable.</p>
    <h2 align="center"><a href="yellowstone.html">Yellowstone National Park July 2016</a></h2>
    <p align="left">I visited Yellowstone in July 2016 with my
      family and my uncle. Yellowstone was probably the most extensive
      trip i had ever made. Hills and Valleys were to be seen
      everywhere we went and there were countless numbers of lakes,
      meadows, rivers and streams. The most interesting part of the
      trip was when we were able to see the sulfur lakes which looked
      much better than they smelled. Remembering that the entire park
      sat upon a dormant volcano didn't make me feel any better about
      it. Nevertheless, it was amazing to see how the different
      compounds combined with each other in order to make beautiful
      colors across the water. We then went to look at the geysers.
      None of them were particularly interesting except for Old
      Faithful which went about 2 stories high. Finally, we went
      outside the park to look at the Grand Teton and take pictures of
      the wonderful scenery there.</p>
    <h2 align="center"><a href="norcal.html">NorCal and Oregon</a></h2>
    <p align="left">I went to Burney Falls, Crater Lake, and
      Lassen Peak in July 2016 right after the Yellowstone trip.
      Although I was definitely tired of driving in a car for hours on
      end in Idaho, the trip did not disappoint. We first went to
      Crater Lake in Oregon. The scenery was amzing and we took many
      pictures of the lake and the forests around it. The next day, we
      went to Burney Falls. We hiked two miles down to the falls and
      took more pictures. The most interesting for me however, was
      Lassen National Park. It was very similar to Yellowstone in the
      sense that Lassen also had sulfur lakes and mini geysers which
      definitely made it a highlight.</p>
    <h2 align="center"><a href="yosemite.html">Yosemite National Park August 2016</a></h2>
    <p align="left">I visited Yosemite National Park in August
      2016 again with my family and uncle. Even though I had a severe
      enmity to road trips at this point we drove from San Jose all
      the way to Yosemite. The first word I used to describe Yosemite
      was enormous even though it was not as big as Yellowstone. Large
      mountains ringed the valley which had pine trees scattered all
      over them while the valley had many meadows and lakes. We first
      looked at Half Dome which looked exactly like its name. It stood
      tall above the mountains and was interesting to look at. Then at
      the end of the day, we looked at the sunset which was purple and
      pink and which we took many pictures of. The next day we went on
      a tour of the whole valley. We saw many mountains such as El
      Capitan and we saw many waterfalls. After the tour, we decided
      to climb to Vernal Falls. It took a long time but we finally
      made it to the waterfall and took some amazing pictures.</p>
    <h2 align="center"><a href="cancun.html">Cancun Mexico December 2011</a></h2>
    <p align="left">I visited Cancun from December 18th to 22nd
      2011 with my family and some friends. After we
      arrived in Cancun, we took a bus to the hotel. The hotel was
      grand in all aspects, a sprawling layout with four restaurants,
      two swimming pools,two water slides, gift shops and beautifully
      adorned beaches equipped with lounge chairs and beds. Our stay
      was very comfortable and relaxing. Additionally the hotel also
      provided us with bus service that would pick us and drop us to
      different locations.We reached Cancun late in the evening and
      spend our first day relaxing in the hotel and on the beaches.
      The next day we visited a water park. We did snorkelling, saw
      wild animals and birds, relaxed at the beach and ate seafood. I
      would recommend this place to any one who visits Cancun. In the
      evening, the locals performed a colorful musical program
      representing the Spanish culture. Again a must watch for anyone
      who visits Cancun. The following day we visited Chichinitza,
      famous for it's ancient Mayan pyramids. We had a great time
      learning about the Mayan culture. Our guide Christian explained
      us a lot about its pyramids, their origin and and about the
      people that lived there also known as the Mayans. He also
      informed us about the ancient Mayan rituals and its calendar and
      how it ended at December 21st 2012 which was a surprise since we
      were visiting Chitchinitza on the same day.He also told us that
      the world wasn't going to end but only that a new cycle would
      start.Our bus ride also took us to a gift shop that sold several
      handicrafts. We bought some items from there. You could get the
      same items from the vendors outside the pyramids. We then went
      to visit a "cennote", a large, natural well which was more than
      one hundred yards wide in diameter.Christian told us that most
      of the water in Mexico came from wells like these since there
      weren't many rivers there. At the end of the day, we went to see
      a "light and sound" show that explained how the Mayans ruled
      over Chichinitza. Our trip to Cancun was an excellent trip and I
      would highly recommend you to go there. However, these aren't
      the only places you can go in Cancun. There are many more places
      you can go to in Cancun in which you can have fun!</p>
    <h2 align="center"><a href="canada.html">Canada Trip July 2010</a></h2>
    <p align="left">I visited Canada in the Summer of 2010 with
      my family and my Aunts family. We flew into Chicago from San
      Jose.We rested up for a day and the next day we started on our
      journey to Canada.This was a road trip that took us from Chicago
      to Detriot and then onwards into Canada. Our first stop in
      Canada was the Lion Safari Park. Believe it or not there is a
      small Lion Safari Park in the Ontario Province in Canada. It is
      built on the same lines as a real Lion Safari in Africa. We
      drove through the park in our car and watched wild animals and
      birds up close from inside our car. We stayed there for one day
      and had a really great time, especially my little cousins who
      were totally excited to see lions and monkeys roaming so freely
      in the open. We next visited the Niagra falls from the Canadian
      side. We had seen it earlier from the American side but no
      matter how many times you see this natural wonder you cannot
      stop to be amazed by it. We also took the "Maid of the Mist"
      boat ride that takes you up close to the base of the falls.The
      sheer volume of water and mist completely blinds you as you
      reach close to the base of the falls. The next couple of days we
      spend site seeing in Toronto. We tried different cuisines and
      had a great time visiting different places in Toronto.My little
      cousins really enjoyed our trip to Center Island a small island
      on Lake Ontario". The next day we headed North on our way to
      Montreal. Before we reached Montreal we took a small detour and
      did a boat trip of "Thousand Islands" on St. Lawrence river. The
      houses on the naturally formed islands in the river looked
      beautiful which made it an unique experience. After finishing
      the boat trip we drove to Montreal. We reached there late in the
      night. One interesting transformation in Montreal was all signs
      and billboards are in French. We slept in a hotel at night and
      next day morning we were up early in the morning for some sight
      seeing of the city. We took a trip of the old city in a horse
      carriage. One of the most beautiful Cathederal that I have seen
      was the Notre Dame Cathedral. The interiors of the Cathedral is
      really ornate. The trip to Canada was one of the most memorable
      trips. We had a great time as a family as well.</p>
    <h2 align="center"><a href="northeast.html">North East Trip July 2009</a></h2>
    <p align="left">I visited the east coast of US in the Summer
      of 2009 with my family and grandparents. We flew in from San
      Jose to New York. The first few days we stayed and visited New
      York city. I was amazed by the tall buildings and traffic in
      Manhattan. We spent a day on Ellis Island, Statue of Liberty and
      Battery park. I did not realize how big the Statue of Liberty
      was until I actually saw it. The view of New York skyline from
      the Statue of Liberty was awesome. We also visited the famous
      Times Square in Manhattan. The next part of our trip was on
      road. We rented a van and drove to Niagara falls. We were all
      spell bound when we saw the falls. The size of the falls is not
      as tall as you would expect it to be but the view is quite
      mesmerizing. We took a boat ride "Maid of the Mist" that takes
      you closer to the foot of the falls. The boat ride was
      thrilling. The mist created by the falls would have soaked us
      had we not worn ponchos. Later we came back in the night to view
      the lights that are shone on the falls. It was a great
      experience. We then started back on the journey to visit
      Washington DC. The route was beautiful. The countryside was lush
      green and blooming. We stopped in the night at New Jersey where
      we met a few family friends and had a great dinner. Next day
      morning we reached Washington DC. We spent two days in
      Washington DC.On the first day we visited the Washington
      Monument, the White house and the Capitol Hill. The next day we
      visited the museums in Washington DC. We visited several
      museums. I really liked the National Air and Space Museum and
      the National Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian). We enjoyed
      the trip very much.This was one of the most interesting learning
      experiences.
