								I have several hobbies like playing video games, programming on
								computers, building and programming robots, music and reading.<br>
								<br> I like playing video games whenever I find time. Video
								games have always been a part of my hobby. I enjoy being a part
								of the adventure and action of the game.My favorite video game
								currently is "Halo:The master chief collection". Checkout the
								video games section in my website.<br> <br> I have
								been around computers from a very young age. I have always
								enjoyed seeing my programming creation come to life on a screen.
								I can currently program in Java, HTML and Javascript. I hope to
								learn many more programming languages and build some amazing
								programs in future.I also wish that in the future I will get a
								job as a computer scientist. <br> <br> Robotics is
								another of my favorite hobbies. Growing up I loved playing with
								Legos. I was really good at building complicated stuff. My dad
								later introduced me to building and programming robots using the
								Lego Mindstorm kit. Programming the robot was really fun and was
								my first step into the world of programming. <br> First
								Lego League is an organization that hosts a Robotics competition
								in the United States. I have participated in this Robotics
								competition from 3rd to 7th grade. It is really a fun and
								educational event. The competition is based on a theme. The
								theme for 2012 competition was "Senior Solutions". In 2011 the
								theme was "Food Contamination". Participants work in a team and
								build robots and execute missions as per the instructions
								outlined in the competition. Additionally teams are supposed to
								execute a project in an area pertaining to the competition
								theme. I have enjoyed these competition very much. See the
								pictures of our robot on this site. Currently I am a member
								"Robotics Club" in my school<br> <br> I also love to
								listen to music. I listen to modern and classic rock, as well as
								a little bit of rap and pop music. I've also learned to play the
								piano and have participated in many recitals. Check out my
								recital videos. <br> <br>Growing up I also loved to
								play Ping Pong (or Table Tennis). I learned to play the game as
								a fun game with my family. Later as I got better at it my
								parents introduced me to ping pong coach!! Check out the
								pictures of me playing.<br> <br> Since sixth grade, I
								have been a part of Boy Scouts. I am currently a Life Scout in
								Troop 290 and have had many amazing experiences with my troop.
								Whether it be camping, hiking, or running a troop meeting, Boy
								Scouts has always been something that I love to be a part of. <br>
								<br>Another hobby of mine is watching movies. "Star Wars"
								has been my favorite movie series ever since it was introduced
								to me by a friend at the age of five. I love all of the movies -
								except for the prequels :D - and I am always interested in "Star
								Wars" lore and theories about any future movies. I also love to
								watch superhero movies like "The Avengers" and "Guardians of the
								Galaxy".<br> <br>I also love to read books in my spare
								time. I prefer to read fiction novels.Some of my favorite series
								include "Harry Potter" by J.K. Rowling, "The Secrets of the
								Immortal Nicholas Flamel" by Michael Scott, "The Heroes of
								Olympus" by Rick Riordan, the "Inheritance" series by
								Christopher Paolini, and "The Mysterious Benedict Society" by
								Trenton Lee Stewart.
