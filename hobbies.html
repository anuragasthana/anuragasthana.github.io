		<p>I have several hobbies like playing video games, programming on computers,
		building and programming robots, music and reading.<br><br> Playing video
		games is one of my favorite pastimes. My favorite video game currently is
		"Halo: The master chief collection". Check out the video games section in my
		website.<br> <br> Robotics is another of my favorite hobbies. Growing up I
		loved playing with Legos. I was really good at building complicated stuff.
		When I was in elementary school, I was introduced to building and
		programming robots using the Lego MindStorm kit. Programming the robot was
		really fun and was my first step into the world of programming. Programming
		these robots was my first introduction to the FLL competitions. The theme
		for 2012 competition was "Senior Solutions". In 2011 the
		theme was "Food Contamination". Participants work in a team and build robots and
 		execute missions as per the instructions outlined in the competition.
 		Additionally teams are supposed to execute a project in an area pertaining to
 		the competition theme. I have enjoyed these competition very much. Thes fun
 		competitions inspired me to participate in the FLL for four years. <br> <br> I
 		also love to listen to music. I listen to modern and classic rock, as well as
 		a little bit of rap and soft rock. I've also learned to play the piano and have
		participated in many recitals. Check out my recital videos. <br> <br>Growing
		up I also loved to play Ping Pong (or Table Tennis). I learned to play the
		game as a fun game with my family. Later as I got better at it my parents
		introduced me to ping pong coach who participated in the Olympics! Check out
		the pictures of me playing.<br> <br> Since sixth grade, I have been a part of
		Boy Scouts. I am currently a Life Scout in Troop 290 and have had many amazing
	 	experiences with my troop. Whether it be camping, hiking, or running a troop
	 	meeting, Boy Scouts has always been something that I love to be a part of.
	 	<br><br>Another hobby of mine is watching movies. "Star Wars" has been my
	 	favorite movie series ever since it was introduced to me by a friend at the
	 	age of five. I am always interested in "Star Wars" lore and theories about
	 	any future movies. I also love to watch superhero movies like "The Avengers"
	 	and "Guardians of the Galaxy".<br> <br>I also love to read books in my spare
	 	time. I prefer to read fiction novels.Some of my favorite series include
	 	"Harry Potter" by J.K. Rowling, "The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel"
	  by Michael Scott, "The Heroes of Olympus" by Rick Riordan, the "Inheritance"
		series by Christopher Paolini, "The Mysterious Benedict Society" by Trenton
		Lee Stewart and “The Lord of The Rings” by JRR Tolkien.
